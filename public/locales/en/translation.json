    "Project1": "### Visualization of 3D Models\n\nWith Three.js, I can render complex models with photographic accuracy in a 3D scene. This means we can enjoy detailed and realistic models without needing to install additional software.\n\n### Interactive Controls\n\nI have integrated OrbitControls to provide smooth and natural navigation.\n\n- **Rotation**: Use the left mouse button to rotate the model and explore it from different angles.\n- **Zoom**: Adjust the zoom with the mouse wheel to observe specific details up close or to get an overview of the entire model.\n- **Pan**: Move the camera horizontally and vertically by holding down the right mouse button to get the perfect perspective.\n\n### Adaptability and Responsiveness\n\nThe project design is optimized to adapt perfectly to different screen sizes. This ensures that the viewing experience is equally excellent on both mobile devices and desktop computers, without compromising quality or functionality.",

    "GameProject": "## Game Project\n\n## Game Explanation\n\n### General Description\nHello! I want to show you a project I have been working on. I have integrated a Unity game into a web application using `react-unity-webgl`. It's a fantastic way to demonstrate my skills in both Unity and web development. Below, I tell you what the game is about and how to play it. It is based on the Unity Learn 3D Game Kit.\n\n### Game Objective\nThe main objective of the game is to explore a world full of adventures, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies as you progress through different levels.\n\n### Game Controls and Mechanics\n- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys or W, A, S, D to move your character.\n- **Jump**: Press the spacebar to make your character jump.\n- **Attack**: Press the left mouse button to attack enemies.\n- **Interact**: Press the E key to interact with objects or NPCs.\n- **Run**: Hold down the Shift key to run.\n- **Switch Weapon**: Use the Q key to switch between available weapons.\n\n### Additional Instructions or Tips\n- **Exploration**: Take time to explore each level. There are many secrets and hidden items that can be very useful.\n- **Puzzles**: Some levels have puzzles that you must solve to progress. Observe your surroundings and use available objects creatively.\n- **Health and Energy**: Keep an eye on your health and energy bars. Health decreases when you take damage, and energy is used for special actions.\n- **Checkpoints**: The game has checkpoints. If you lose all your health, you will respawn at the last checkpoint you reached.\n- **Power-Ups**: Look for power-ups that can enhance your abilities, such as increased speed or temporary invincibility.\n- **Enemies**: Each type of enemy has a different strategy to defeat. Observe their patterns and adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\n### Integration Details\nThis Unity game, based on the Unity Learn 3D Game Kit, is seamlessly integrated into a React application thanks to the `react-unity-webgl` library. This allows the game to run smoothly directly in the browser, offering a fluid and responsive experience. It is an excellent demonstration of how Unity and modern web technologies can be combined.\n\n### How to Play\nTo play, simply open the web application and wait for the Unity WebGL build to load. Once loaded, you can start playing by following the instructions above.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed developing it!",
